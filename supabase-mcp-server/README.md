# Supabase MCP Server (Planned Skeleton)

This folder will host the future Supabase MCP server as a sibling to zen-mcp-server.

Goals:
- Tools for vector upsert/query, match_documents, migrations, RLS sanity checks
- Uses pgvector 2000-dim MRL embeddings
- Integrates with the main system without disrupting zen-mcp-server

Next steps (after approval):
- Scaffold virtual environment and mcp-config.json
- Implement list-tools and basic connectivity checks
- Add docs for Supabase auth, RLS policies, and RPC usage
