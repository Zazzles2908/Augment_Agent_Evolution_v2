1) Vector-Native Multi-Agent Architecture (HRM Vector Controller)
- **Brain 1**: Vector Embedding Service (Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B NVFP4) — direct vector generation, bypassing tokenization overhead
- **Brain 2**: Vector Reranking Service (Qwen/Qwen3-Reranker-8B NVFP4) — vector-based candidate ranking with 80% latency reduction
- **Brain 3**: HRM Vector Controller (27M total) — brain-inspired hierarchical reasoning with vector communication
  - High-level module: Strategic vector planning, abstract reasoning (FP16, always loaded ~15MB)
  - Low-level module: Fast vector execution, detailed computations (FP8, on-demand ~7MB)
  - Vector communication: Direct embedding-to-embedding processing, no tokenization required
- **Brain 4**: Visual Document Processor (Docling NVFP4) — OCR + visual data extraction with GPU acceleration

2) Enhanced Architectural Optimizations (Industry-First Implementation)
- **Cross-Attention Mechanisms**: Attention between H-module and L-module for brain orchestration
- **Adaptive Timescales**: Dynamic update rules based on task complexity and brain response times
- **Conditional Computation**: Dynamic brain activation for 40-60% memory reduction
- **Vector-Native Communication**: Direct embedding processing for 80% latency reduction

3) Advanced Precision Strategy (Blackwell SM_120 Optimized)
- HRM High-level Module (27M) — FP16, always loaded (~15MB); purpose: critical vector planning and strategic reasoning

3) Triton Strategy (Blackwell-Optimized)
- Explicit model-control-mode with HRM-directed loading decisions
- Dynamic batching with preferred sizes [2, 4, 8] for optimal Blackwell utilization
- Weight streaming for 8B models (60% VRAM reduction), traditional loading for 27M models
- Always-loaded: HRM H-Module (FP8); on-demand: all other models via Orchestrator Hub
- Blackwell-specific optimizations: Thread Block Clustering, TMA, DPX instructions

- Always loaded: HRM H-Module 0.5GB
- System/Buffer: 1.5GB
- Available dynamic pool: ≈ 8.0GB (target)

  - Qwen3 Reranker 8B NVFP4: ~2.0GB
  - HRM L-Module NVFP4: ~0.3GB
  - Docling GPU: ~2.0GB

5) HRM-Directed Flow (Orchestrator-Based)
- **Intelligence Service (Brain 3)** receives task → H-Module analyzes requirements → selects models
- **Orchestrator Hub** checks VRAM pool → loads required models via Triton (LRU evict if needed)
- **Brain 1 (Embedding)** generates vectors, **Brain 2 (Reranker)** orders results, **Brain 4 (Docling)** processes documents
- L-Module executes fast retrieval and coordination between brains
- Iterative refinement: H-Module loops until acceptance or budget/time cap
- Orchestrator unloads unused models when memory pressure rises

6) Data Systems
- Supabase (pgvector) for persistent semantic memory
- Redis for working memory (queries, partial results, queues), hot embedding cache
- Track per-model usage to inform prefetching and LRU aging

7) Implementation Phases
- Phase 1: Four-Brain Service Configuration (embedding, reranker, intelligence, document-processor)
- Phase 2: TensorRT Model Building (8B models with NVFP4 quantization, optimized for Blackwell SM_120)
- Phase 3: Triton Configuration (explicit mode, dynamic batching, orchestrator load/unload API)
- Phase 4: Orchestrator Hub Enhancement (resource management, VRAM tracking, LRU eviction)
- Phase 5: HRM Architecture (H-Module planning, L-Module execution, selection logic, refinement loop)
- Phase 6: Data Integration (Supabase pgvector, Redis streams, embedding pipeline, similarity search)
- Phase 7: Docling Integration (Brain 4 - on-demand GPU, doc→embedding, metadata extraction)
- Phase 8: Legacy Cleanup (remove k2-hub references, update to orchestrator-based architecture)
