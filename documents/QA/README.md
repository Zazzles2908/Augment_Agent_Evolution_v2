## Key Metrics

| Metric | Current State | Target State | Gap |
|--------|---------------|--------------|-----|
| Test Coverage | <5% | >80% | CRITICAL |
| Security Score | Poor | Good | HIGH |
| Architecture Alignment | 30% | >90% | HIGH |
| Documentation Accuracy | 60% | >95% | MEDIUM |
| Deployment Readiness | 20% | >95% | CRITICAL |

## Immediate Actions Required

### Week 1 Priority
1. **Fix embedding dimensions** to 2000-dim for pgvector compatibility
2. **Implement Docling integration** to replace placeholder code
3. **Clean up legacy models** per Phase 0 requirements
4. **Address critical security vulnerabilities**

### Week 2 Priority
1. **Standardize CUDA requirements** across all documentation
2. **Implement basic monitoring** for system observability
3. **Add unit testing framework** with initial test coverage
4. **Centralize configuration management**

## Success Criteria
