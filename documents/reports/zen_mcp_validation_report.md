# Zen MCP Validation and Improvement Report

Branch/PR: chore/zen-mcp-v2-robustness-doc-tweaks (#5)

## Overview
Using the innate `zen` tools from this chat, I validated the MCP server and applied small robustness/UX fixes guided by Zen’s suggestions (provider visibility and client setup clarity). I executed representative tool calls and captured outcomes, then updated code/docs accordingly. This report summarizes what I ran, what I observed, and what I changed.

## Environment
- Client MCP entry: zen-mcp-server/.zen_venv/Scripts/python.exe + zen-mcp-server/server.py (single-line Command)
- Env highlights: Default_model=auto, Locale=en-AU, Cost_profile=balanced, Auggie_CLI=true
- Providers: Kimi (kimi-k2-0711-preview), GLM (glm-4.5-air)

## Probes and Outcomes

1) version (utility)
- Command: /zen:version
- Outcome: OK. Reported 5.8.5 and server path; functional.
- Action: None required.

2) listmodels (utility)
- Command: /zen:listmodels
- Outcome: Functional, but utility UI sometimes obscured native Kimi/GLM as first-class providers depending on client.
- Change applied: Updated listmodels to show KIMI + GLM first, with env key hints.

3) chat (Kimi)
- Command: /zen:chat model:kimi-k2-0711-preview prompt:"Sanity reply with model name"
- Outcome: OK. Responded and identified Kimi model.
- Action: None.

4) chat (GLM)
- Command: /zen:chat model:glm-4.5-air prompt:"Sanity reply with model name"
- Outcome: OK. Responded and identified GLM model.
- Action: None.

5) analyze (workflow)
- Command: /zen:analyze step:"Check tool registry and provider visibility" relevant_files:[server.py, tools/registry.py]
- Outcome: Suggested surfacing native providers early in diagnostics and clarifying client Command vs Args.
- Changes applied: listmodels/version ordering, docs section 3b (single-line Command).

6) debug (workflow)
- Command: /zen:debug step:"Heartbeat check; no bug, ensure structured response" relevant_files:[tools/debug.py]
- Outcome: OK. Suggested minor doc polish found: typo "bas64" → "base64" in Chat tool docstring.
- Change applied: Fixed typo in tools/chat.py.

7) planner (workflow)
- Note: The client wrapper "planner_zen" is not exposed here; the server tool "planner" exists and loads. No server-side errors observed.
- Action: No server code change needed.

## Code Changes (snippets)

- listmodels: add KIMI/GLM provider visibility
```
ProviderType.KIMI: {"name": "Moonshot Kimi", "env_key": "KIMI_API_KEY"},
ProviderType.GLM:  {"name": "ZhipuAI GLM", "env_key": "GLM_API_KEY"},
```

- version: ensure KIMI/GLM surfaced first in provider checks
```
provider_types = [ProviderType.KIMI, ProviderType.GLM, ProviderType.GOOGLE, ProviderType.OPENAI, ...]
```

- chat: docstring typo fix
```
"... OR these can be base64 data)"
```

- VS Code Zen MCP guide: single-line Command (for clients without Args)
```
"C:/.../.zen_venv/Scripts/python.exe" "C:/.../zen-mcp-server/server.py"
```

## Result
- Tools loaded: 16 (chat, analyze, planner, thinkdeep, listmodels, version, challenge, codereview, consensus, debug, docgen, precommit, refactor, tracer, testgen, secaudit)
- Providers usable: Kimi and GLM validated via chat; analyze/debug operational
- No server errors observed; red dots seen earlier were wrapper/client-level (not server)

## Remaining Checks Before Merge
- Quick run from your v2-wired client:
  - /zen:version and /zen:listmodels should show Kimi + GLM
  - /zen:chat (kimi) and /zen:chat (glm) should respond
  - /zen:analyze and /zen:debug should execute
- If any probe shows a red dot, capture zen-mcp-server/logs/mcp_server.log first error lines; I will patch immediately.

## Conclusion
Zen MCP v2 is functional and robust for core workflows. I’ve opened PR #5 with minimal improvements and this documentation. With green probes in your client, I will merge to main.
